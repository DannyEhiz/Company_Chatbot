# Organisation-Specific Chatbot

This project is a chatbot program designed to provide human-like responses to users seeking information. The chatbot is able to differentiate between questions that are specific to the organisation it is programmed for and questions that are not organisation-specific.

## Features
- Provides normal, non organisation-specific responses when questions do not relate to the target organisation
- Gives the best possible response when the user's question relates to the target organisation
- For demonstration purposes, the target organisation used in this project is Gomycode

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install any necessary dependencies
3. Run the chatbot program
4. Ask questions related to Gomycode to see how the chatbot responds

## Technologies Used
